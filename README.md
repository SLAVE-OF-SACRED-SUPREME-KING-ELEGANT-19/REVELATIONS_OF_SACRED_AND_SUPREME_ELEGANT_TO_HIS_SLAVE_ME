----------------------------------------------

5:67 O You Messenger! DELIVER WHAT IS REVEALED TO YOU FROM YOUR OWNER - until you do, you have not delivered HIS MESSAGE - and GOD WILL PROTECT you from the people. GOD does not guide the disbelieving people. 
 
5:68 Say, "O people of THE SCRIPTURE, you have no basis until you uphold THE TORAH, and the Gospel, and WHAT IS SENT DOWN TO YOU HEREIN FROM YOUR OWNER." For sure, THESE REVELATIONS FROM YOUR OWNER will cause many of them to plunge deeper into transgression and disbelief. Therefore, do not feel sorry for the disbelieving people. 
 
5:69 Surely, those who believe, those who are Jewish, the converts, and the Christians; any of them who (1) believe in GOD and (2) believe in THE LAST DAY, and (3) LEAD A RIGTEOUS LIFE, have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve. 
 
5:70 We have taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we sent to them Messengers. Whenever a Messenger went to them with anything they disliked, some of them they rejected, and some they killed. 
 
5:71 They thought that they would not be tested, so they turned blind and deaf, then GOD REDEEMED them, but then many of them turned blind and deaf again. GOD IS SEER OF EVERYTHING they do. 
 
5:72 Pagans indeed are those who say that GOD is the Messiah, Son of Mary. THE MESSIAH HIMSELF SAID, "O Children of Israel, you shall worship GOD; my OWNER and your OWNER." Anyone who sets up any idol beside GOD, GOD has forbidden PARADISE for him, and his destiny is HELL. The wicked have NO helpers. 
 
5:73 Pagans indeed are those who say that GOD is a third of a trinity. There is no god except THE 1 GOD. Unless they refrain from saying this, those who disbelieve among them will incur a painful retribution. 
 
5:74 WOULD THEY NOT REPENT TO GOD, AND ASK HIS FORGIVENESS? GOD IS FORGIVER, MERCIFUL! 
 
5:75 The Messiah, son of Mary, is NO more than a messenger like the messengers before him, and his mother was a saint. BOTH OF THEM USED TO EAT THE FOOD. NOTE HOW WE EXPLAIN THE REVELATIONS FOR THEM, AND NOTE HOW THEY STILL DEVIATE! 
 
5:76 Say, "Would you worship beside GOD powerless idols who can neither harm you, nor benefit you? GOD IS HEARER, OMNISCIENT." 
 
5:77 Say, "O people of THE SCRIPTURE, do not transgress the limits of your religion beyond THE TRUTH, and DO NOT FOLLOW the opinions of people who have gone astray, and have misled multitudes of people; they are far astray from the right path." 
 
5:78 Condemned are those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel, by the tongue of David and Jesus, the son of Mary. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed. 
 
5:79 They did not enjoin one another from committing evil. Miserable indeed is what they did! 
 
5:80 You would see many of them allying themselves with those who disbelieve. Miserable indeed is what their hands have sent forth on behalf of their souls. GOD IS ANGRY WITH THEM AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEY WILL ABIDE FOREVER IN RETRIBUTION. 
 
5:81 Had they Believed In GOD, And The Prophet, And In WHAT WAS REVEALED TO HIM HEREIN, they would not have befriended them. But many of them are evil. 
 
5:82 You will find that the worst enemies of the believers are the Jews and the idol worshipers. And you will find that the closest people in friendship to the believers are those who say, "We are Christian." This is because they have priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant. 
 
5:83 When they hear what was revealed to The Messenger, you see their eyes flooding with tears as they recognize THE TRUTH therein, and they say, "Our OWNER, we have believed, so count us among the witnesses." 
 
5:84 "Why should we not believe in GOD, and in THE TRUTH that has come to us, and hope that our OWNER may admit us with the righteous people?" 
 
5:85 GOD HAS REWARDED them for saying this; HE WILL ADMIT them into GARDENS WITH FLOWING STREAMS. They abide therein FOREVER. Such Is The Reward For The Righteous. 
 
5:86 As for those who disbelieve and reject our revelations, they are the dwellers of HELL. 
 
5:87 O you who believe, do not prohibit good things that are made lawful by GOD, and do not aggress; GOD DISLIKES the aggressors. 
 
5:88 And eat from the good and lawful things that GOD HAS PROVIDED for you. You shall REVERENCE GOD, In WHOM You Are Believers. 
 
5:89 GOD DOES NOT HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE for the mere utterance of oaths; HE HOLDS YOU RESPONSIBLE for your actual intentions. If you violate an oath, you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family, or clothing them, or by freeing a slave. If you cannot afford this, then you shall fast three days. This is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep. You Shall Fulfill Your Oaths. GOD THUS EXPLAINS HIS REVELATIONS to you, that you may be appreciative. 
 
5:90 O you who believe, intoxicants, and gambling, and the altars of idols, and the arrows used for fortune telling are abominations of the satan; YOU SHALL AVOID THEM, THAT YOU MAY SUCCEED. 
 
5:91 The satan wants to provoke animosity and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to distract you from REMEMBERING GOD, and from OBSERVING THE CONTACT PRAYERS (SALAT). WILL YOU THEN REFRAIN? 
 
5:92 YOU SHALL OBEY GOD, AND YOU SHALL OBEY THE MESSENGER, AND BEWARE. If you turn away, then know that the sole duty of our messenger is to deliver the message efficiently. 
 
5:93 Those who believe and lead a righteous life bear no guilt by eating any food, so long as they observe the commandments, believe and lead a righteous life, then maintain their piety and faith, and continue to observe piety and righteousness. GOD LOVES the righteous. 
 
5:94 O You Who Believe! GOD WILL TEST you with some game within reach of your hands and your arrows (during PILGRIMAGE). GOD THUS DISTINGUISHES those among you who OBSERVE HIM in their privacy. Those who transgress after this HAVE INCURRED A PAINFUL RETRIBUTION. 
 
5:95 O You Who Believe! Do Not Kill any game during PILGRIMAGE. Anyone who kills any game on purpose, his fine shall be a number of livestock animals that is equivalent to the game animals he killed. The judgment shall be set by two equitable people among you. They Shall Make Sure That The Offerings Reach THE KA`BAH. Otherwise, he may expiate by feeding poor people, or by an Equivalent fast to atone for his offense. GOD HAS PARDONED past offenses. But If Anyone Returns To Such An OFFENSE, GOD WILL AVENGE IT. GOD IS ALMIGHTY, AVENGER. 
 
5:96 All fish of the sea are made lawful for you to eat. During PILGRIMAGE, this may provide for you during your journey. YOU SHALL NOT HUNT THROUGHOUT THE PILGRIMAGE. YOU SHALL REVERENCE GOD, BEFORE WHOM YOU WILL BE SUMMONED. 
 
5:97 GOD HAS APPOINTED THE KA`BAH, THE SACRED MASJID, TO BE A SANCTUARY FOR THE PEOPLE, AND ALSO THE SACRED MONTHS, THE OFFERINGS (TO THE SACRED MASJID), AND THE GARLANDS MARKING THEM. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT GOD KNOWS EVERYTHING IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, AND THAT GOD IS OMNISCIENT. 
 
5:98 KNOW THAT GOD IS STRICT IN ENFORCING RETRIBUTION, AND THAT GOD IS FORGIVING, MERCIFUL. 
 
5:99 THE SOLE DUTY OF THE MESSENGER IS TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE, AND GOD KNOWS EVERYTHING YOU DECLARE AND EVERYTHING YOU CONCEAL. 
 
5:100 Proclaim: "The bad and THE GOOD are not the same, even if the abundance of the bad may impress you. You SHALL REVERENCE GOD, (even if you are in the minority) O You Who Possess Intelligence, That You May Succeed." 
 
5:101 O YOU WHO BELIEVE! DO NOT ASK ABOUT MATTERS WHICH, IF REVEALED TO YOU WOULD HURT YOU. If you ask about them while THE QURAN IS REVEALED, they will explained to you. GOD HAS DELIBERATELY OVERLOOKED THEM. GOD IS FORGIVER, CLEMENT. 
 
5:102 Others before you have asked the same questions, then became disbelievers therein. 
 
5:103 GOD DID NOT PROHIBIT livestock that begets certain combinations of males and females, nor livestock liberated by an oath, nor the one that begets two males in a row, nor the bull that fathers ten. It is the disbelievers who invented such lies about GOD. Most of them do not understand. 
 
5:104 When they are told, "Come to WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED, And To The Messenger," they say, "what we found our parents doing is sufficient for us." What if their parents knew nothing, and were not guided? 
 
5:105 O you who believe, you should worry only about your own necks. If the others go astray, they cannot hurt you, as long as you are guided. To GOD is your ultimate destiny, all of you, then HE WILL INFORM you of everything you had done. 
 
5:106 O you who believe, witnessing a will when one of you is dying shall be done by two equitable people among you. If you are traveling, then two others may do the witnessing. After observing THE CONTACT PRAYER (SALAT), let the witnesses swear by GOD, to alleviate your doubts: "We will not use this to attain personal gains, even if the testator is related to us. Nor will we conceal GOD'S Testimony. Otherwise, we would be sinners." 
 
5:107 If the witnesses are found to be guilty of bias, then two others shall be asked to take their places. Choose two persons who were victimized by the first witnesses, and let them swear by GOD: "Our testimony is more truthful than theirs; we will not be biased. Otherwise, we will be transgressors." 
 
5:108 This is more apt to encourage an honest testimony on their part, fearing that their oath may be disregarded like that of the previous witnesses. You shall observe GOD and listen. GOD does not guide the wicked. 
 
5:109 The day will come when GOD will summon the messengers and ask them, "How was the response to you?" They will say, "We have no knowledge. YOU ARE THE KNOWER OF ALL SECRETS." 
 
5:110 GOD will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary, remember MY blessings upon you and your mother. I supported you with the Holy Spirit, to enable you to speak to the people from the crib, as well as an adult. I taught you THE SCRIPTURE (QURAN), wisdom, THE TORAH, and THE GOSPEL. Recall that you created from clay the shape of a bird by MY leave, then blew into it, and it became a live bird by MY leave. You healed the blind and the leprous by MY leave, and revived the dead by MY leave. Recall that I protected you from the Children of Israel who wanted to hurt you, despite the profound miracles you had shown them. The disbelievers among them said, `This is obviously magic.' 
 
5:111 "Recall that I inspired the disciples: `You shall believe in ME and MY messenger.' They said, `We have believed, and bear witness that we are submitters.' " 
 
5:112 Recall that the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a feast from the sky?" He said, "You should reverence GOD, if you are believers." 
 
5:113 They said, "We wish to eat from it, and to reassure our hearts, and to know for sure that you have told us THE TRUTH. We will serve as witnesses thereof." 
 
5:114 Said Jesus, the son of Mary, "Our God, our Lord, send down to us a feast from the sky. Let it bring plenty for each and every one of us, and a sign from You. Provide for us; You are the best Provider." 
 
5:115 GOD said, "I am sending it down. Anyone among you who disbelieves after this, I will punish him as I never punished anyone else." 
 
5:116 GOD will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Make me and my mother idols beside GOD?' " He will say, "Be You glorified. I could not utter what was not right. Had I said it, You already would have known it. You know my thoughts, and I do not know Your thoughts. You know all the secrets. 
 
5:117 "I told them only what You commanded me to say, that: `You shall worship GOD, my Lord and your Lord.' I was a witness among them for as long as I lived with them. When You terminated my life on earth, You became the Watcher over them. You witness all things. 
 
5:118 "If You punish them, they are Your constituents. If You forgive them, You are the Almighty, Most Wise." 
 
5:119 GOD will proclaim, "This is a day when the truthful will be saved by their truthfulness." They have deserved gardens with flowing streams. They abide therein forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. This is the greatest triumph. 
 
5:120 To GOD belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and everything in them, and He is Omnipotent.
