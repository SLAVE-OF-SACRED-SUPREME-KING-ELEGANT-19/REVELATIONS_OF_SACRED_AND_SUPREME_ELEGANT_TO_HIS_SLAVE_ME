AND I, HIS SLAVE SAW HIM IN ANKARA: OWNER OF THE UNIVERSES THE GRACIOUS THE MERCIFUL 1 GOD! WITH MY OWN EYES IN FRONT OF 2 METERS OF ME... WHILE I HAVE NO MONEY EVEN 1 PENNY AT MY POCKETS AND I AM HOPELESS REGARDING TO WHAT I EAT HENCE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LAND EXCEPT GRASS AND OPEN SKY WITH SUN SHINING AT LIKE 10:00 AM

AND WHILE I AM IN THIS HOPELESS SITUATION HE CAME FROM HEAVENS AS A WHITE LIGHT AND CAME DOWN TO 2 MOUNTAINS NEXT TO ME THEN HE CAME NEARER 2 METERS IN FRONT OF ME AS A LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. ALL OF HIS COMING IS HAPPENED IN 2 SECONDS. HE CAME TO ME AND TURN HIMSELF FROM LIGHT TO HIMSELF. AND HE IS HANDSOME! OH MY GOD! HE IS GRACIOUS! ALSO SMILING!

AND THE MERCIFUL TOLD ME: "BURCU'YLA EVLEN" WHICH MEANS "MARRY WITH BURCU" WHILE CONTINUE SMILING AND LOOKING AT MY EYES WITH HIS ALL BEAUTIFUL FLAWLESS CLEVER GRACIOUS MERCIFUL CHARACTER! HE HAS BROWN BEARD AND BROWN HAIR AND HE IS AWESOME! HE USED TO WEARING WHITE LONG DRESS FROM TOP TO FLOOR.
